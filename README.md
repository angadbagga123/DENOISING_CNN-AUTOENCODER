# DENOISING_CNN-AUTOENCODER
IMAGE DENOISING USING CONVOLUTIONAL AUTOENCODER
1) Import all the neccesary libraries such as numpy,keras,matplotlib
2) load the dataset(fashion_mnist) and normalize it for the Model
3) next step is to add noise to the dataset 
4) Our Sequential model is prepared with a separate encoder and deocder
5) following this our model is trained with noisy data so as to get our noiseless output
